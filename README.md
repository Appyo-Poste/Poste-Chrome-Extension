# Poste-Chrome-Extension
There are two paths we could develope this down. One being a stand alone exprince that allows the user to have the full functionality of a Poste by it self. The other option would be to have it used along side a webstie allowing esay saving of web pages in Poste, but later viewing would only be done though the web site. 
## Chrome Extension general info
Chrome extensions are quite similar to web development. Development makes use of HTML, javascrpit, and CSS with the main diffrence being that Chrome extensions make use a manifest.json file that holds infomation about the files used by the extension. HTMl is used for the screens with CSS to help with styling, then javascrpit is use for the functionalty of the pages. 

## Chrome Extension development tools
Chrome web browser for testing.

Any tool that can do HTML and Javascrpit can be used for extension devlopment. No single one seems to more recommend then any other.
